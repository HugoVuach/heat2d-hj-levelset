## Optimization of heat diffusion in 2D at constant volume, using finite volumes and a level-set method via Hamilton–Jacobi equation.

We study the problem of heat diffusion in a two-dimensional fluid containing a compact hot subdomain embedded in a colder background, with uniform but distinct initial temperatures. The objective is to determine the shape that maximizes the short-time diffusion rate between the two regions. The problem is modeled and simulated using the finite volume method on a triangular mesh. A preliminary test with a simple shape-perturbation algorithm illustrates the effect of geometry on diffusion. Building on this, we develop a level-set based optimization method: the evolving interface is represented by a level-set function, and an iterative procedure is applied where a cost functional drives the deformation of the shape toward an optimal configuration. This framework allows for a more systematic and efficient exploration of shape variations, ultimately yielding improved diffusion performance. The work is conducted within the framework of the projects of the Mathematical Modeling of Complex Systems section at CentraleSupélec.
